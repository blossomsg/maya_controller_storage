Node Issue: curveInfo, once calculates more knots, wont calculate less knots 

Hello Guys,

I have been facing an issue with maya curveinfo node,

so i have an eg(excuse the names),
cube_cone_curves
i created cube curve by snapping ep curve on cube poly
and then created another curve snapping points on cone poly

and parented both the curveShapes, with below command
parent -r -s <curveShapeName> <transformName>;

and then duplicated curves and and renamed again the curves and shapes to avoid name clashes

Now the problem begins
firstcase:-
1 transform 2 shapes, 
i want "knot values" of both the shapes, so i create a curveinfo node and gave inputCurve for cubeShape 1
query knot values with
cmds.getAttr("curveInfo3.knots") 

disconnect and connect again inputCurve for Coneshape 2
query knot values with
cmds.getAttr("curveInfo3.knots") 

secondcase:-
1 transform 2 shapes, 
i want "knot values" of both the shapes, so i create 2 curveinfo nodes and give connect cubeShape 1 and coneShape 2 to curveInfo 1 and curveInfo 2
query knot values with
cmds.getAttr("curveInfo1.knots")
cmds.getAttr("curveInfo2.knots")

if you see the results its different 
12 knots for cone
18 knots for cube

There are workarounds but needed to bring to your notice, 
it makes it difficult to use single curveinfo for multiple curves(during for loop, connect and disconnect to multiple curves), it might give wrong values
or i also might be wrong its purpose is to be used once 
and for second curve we need new curveInfo, waiting for your feedback
